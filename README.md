## **Important Notes** ⚠️

- **API Rate Limits:** Both OpenWeatherMap and RapidAPI have rate limits on the number of API calls you can make per minute/hour. Exceeding these limits may result in temporary suspension of access to their services. Make sure to monitor your usage and upgrade your plan if necessary.

- **API Key Security:** Never expose your API keys publicly in repositories, especially on platforms like GitHub. Always use environment variables or secure methods to manage API keys in production environments.

- **Usage Best Practices:** To optimize the performance of your application, avoid making unnecessary API calls. Implement caching mechanisms and make sure to handle API errors gracefully.
